# NodeExpressBootstrap
A repo with a base Node/Express/Bootstrap configuration (built from express-generator)

Got super annoyed that I couldn't find a decent NodeJS/Express/Bootstrap generator so I made one in GitHub.

### To Use:
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/rayterrill/NodeExpressBootstrap.git
```
2. Install client-side dependencies using Bower:
```
bower install
```
3. Install NodeJS dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Fire up the server:
```
npm start
```
5. Profit.
